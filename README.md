# EyeStrategy: RL modeling of eye movement strategy on others' faces

A project for the graduation thesis @ SNU Psychology.


### EDA 

An exploratory analysis for the eye tracking data on human faces([Wilming et al, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016126)), which is a public dataset from `Nature Scientific Data`.

### EyeSurvival

A survival analysis approach on the first fixation duration on the facial stimuli as a function of ROIs. It is actually a final project for an undergraduate course  `Survival Data Analysis(001)`, 2018, *Seoul National University*. 

### EyeSequential

A sequential decision-making based modeling of eye movement strategy on others' faces. A CNN model that reflects an attention span is implemented.
